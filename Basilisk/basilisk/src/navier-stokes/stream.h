/**
# A streamfunction--vorticity solver for the Navier--Stokes equations

In two dimensions the incompressible, constant-density Navier--Stokes
equations can be written
$$
\partial_t\omega + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\omega = \nu\nabla^2\omega
$$
$$
\nabla^2\psi = \omega
$$
with $\nu$ the viscosity coefficient. The vorticity $\omega$ and
streamfunction $\psi$ are defined as
$$
\omega = \partial_x u_y - \partial_y u_x
$$
$$
u_x = - \partial_y\psi
$$
$$
u_y = \partial_x\psi
$$
The equation for the vorticity is an advection--diffusion equation
which can be solved using the flux--based advection scheme in
[`advection.h`](/src/advection.h). The equation for the streamfunction
is a [Poisson equation](/src/poisson.h). */
