# Interfacial forces

We assume that the interfacial acceleration can be expressed as
$$
\phi\mathbf{n}\delta_s/\rho
$$
with $\mathbf{n}$ the interface normal, $\delta_s$ the interface Dirac
function, $\rho$ the density and $\phi$ a generic scalar field. Using
a CSF/Peskin-like approximation, this can be expressed as
$$
\phi\nabla f/\rho
$$
with $f$ the volume fraction field describing the interface.

The interfacial force potential $\phi$ is associated to each VOF
tracer. This is done easily by adding the following [field
attributes](/Basilisk C#field-attributes). */
