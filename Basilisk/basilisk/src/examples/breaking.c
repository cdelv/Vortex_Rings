# 3D breaking Stokes wave (multilayer solver)

A steep, 3D, third-order Stokes wave is unstable and breaks. This is
the 3D equivalent of this [test case](/src/test/stokes.c). The
bathymetry is given by
$$
z_b(y) = - 0.5 + \sin(\pi y)/4
$$
i.e. it is shallower toward the back of the domain which causes the
wave to break earlier there.

![Animation of the free-surface. The surface is coloured according to
 the $x$-component of the surface velocity.](breaking/movie.mp4)(
 width=100% )

The solution is obtained using the layered model and demonstrates its
robustness and a degree of realism even for this complex case. */
