## Parallel runs

These simulations are expensive (in 3D), mostly because of the
timestep restriction due to surface tension and of the long evolution
required to reach an established quasi-stationary regime. The results
presented below were obtained using 96 cores on [occigen at
CINES](https://www.cines.fr/calcul/materiels/occigen/) in 12 hours for
each bubble. To run the simulation in 3D use

~~~bash
local% qcc -source -grid=octree -D_MPI=1 bubble.c
local% scp _bubble.c occigen.cines.fr:
~~~

and see the [isotropic turbulence
example](isotropic.c#running-with-mpi-on-occigen) for details.

## Results

The evolution of the bubble Reynols number for bubble 19 and 26 can be
compared to Figures 20.c and 20.f respectively of Cano-Lozano et al,
2016. The results are close, although the transition to established
regime seems to be faster in Basilisk. The final Reynolds numbers are
comparable (within a few percent) but the amplitude of oscillation
seems to be somewhat larger in Basilisk. Note that the Basilisk
results presented here use a different resolution for the bubble and
its wake than the Gerris results of Cano-Lozano et al, 2016.
