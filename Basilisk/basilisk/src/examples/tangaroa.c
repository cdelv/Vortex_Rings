# Two-phase flow around RV Tangaroa

This is an improved version of the [famous Gerris
example](http://gerris.dalembert.upmc.fr/gerris/examples/examples/tangaroa.html),
illustrating the combination of complex solid boundaries, air-water
turbulent flows and reduced gravity approach. 

We use the centered Navier--Stokes solver, two-phase flow and the
momentum-conserving option. Note that the momentum-conserving option
is crucial to obtain stable solutions for this air-water density ratio
configuration. */

## Running in parallel on Irene

Running with MPI-parallelism is a bit more complicated than usual
since the `distance()` function is not parallelised yet. A reasonably
simple workaround is to first generate a restart/dump file on the
local machine, without MPI, using something like:

~~~bash
CFLAGS=-DDUMP=1 make tangaroa.tst
~~~

(and also adjust the maximum level), then kill the running code (using
Ctrl-C) and do:

~~~bash
qcc -source -D_MPI=1 tangaroa.c
scp _tangaroa.c popinets@irene.ccc.cea.fr:/ccc/scratch/cont003/gen7325/popinets
scp tangaroa/dump-0 popinets@irene.ccc.cea.fr:/ccc/scratch/cont003/gen7325/popinets/restart
~~~

then on irene (to run on 480 cores for 10 hours, with 12 levels of refinement):

~~~bash
ssh popinets@irene.ccc.cea.fr
ccc_mpp -u popinets
sed 's/WALLTIME/36000/g' run.sh | ccc_msub -n 480
~~~

with the following `run.sh` script

~~~bash
#!/bin/bash
#MSUB -r tangaroa
#MSUB -T WALLTIME
#MSUB -@ popinet@basilisk.fr:begin,end
#MSUB -o basilisk_%I.out
#MSUB -e basilisk_%I.log
#MSUB -q skylake
#MSUB -A gen7760
#MSUB -m scratch
##MSUB -w

set -x
cd ${BRIDGE_MSUB_PWD}

mpicc -Wall -std=c99 -O2 _tangaroa.c -o tangaroa -I$HOME -L$HOME/gl -lglutils -lfb_osmesa -lOSMesa -lGLU -lm
ccc_mprun -n ${BRIDGE_MSUB_NPROC} ./tangaroa -m WALLTIME 12 0.4 \
    2>> log-${BRIDGE_MSUB_NPROC} >> out-${BRIDGE_MSUB_NPROC}
~~~

### Generating MP4 movies

Note that when running on Irene the [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
MP4 encoder is not available and the logfile will contain the warning:

~~~bash
open_image(): cannot find 'ppm2mp4' or 'ffmpeg'/'avconv'
  falling back to raw PPM outputs
~~~

The MP4 files defined above will be renamed `movie.mp4.ppm` and
`l2.mp4.ppm`. As the extension indicates, these (large) files are now
raw (uncompressed) PPM images. To convert them to compressed MP4, you
will need to copy them to a machine where ffmpeg (and Basilisk) are
installed (i.e. your local machine) and do:

~~~bash
ppm2mp4 movie.mp4 < movie.mp4.ppm
ppm2mp4 l2.mp4 < l2.mp4.ppm
~~~
