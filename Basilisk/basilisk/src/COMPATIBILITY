This (symmetric) matrix represents the current state of compatibility
of various features in Basilisk: 'yes' means that the features are
compatible and that this has been tested; 'no' means that the features
are known to be incompatible (for the moment) and 'maybe' means that
this may work but has not been tested yet.
