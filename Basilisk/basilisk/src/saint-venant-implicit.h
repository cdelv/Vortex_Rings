# A semi-implicit Saint-Venant solver

<div class="message">
Note that the [multilayer solver](layered/hydro.h) provides the same
functionality and should be prefered for most applications.</div>

We solve the [Saint-Venant equations](saint-venant.h) semi-implicitly
to lift the timestep restriction due to gravity waves. This is just a
particular application of the "all Mach" semi-implicit solver. We will
use the Bell-Collela-Glaz advection scheme to transport mass and
momentum. */

mass $h$ are advected tracers. The acceleration of gravity is
*G*. *dry* is the fluid depth below which a cell is considered

/**
On trees things are a bit more complicated due to the necessity to
verify the "lake-at-rest" condition. For a lake, the pressure gradient
must balance the topographic source term i.e.
$$
\frac{1}{h}\nabla p = a = -g\nabla z_b
$$
with $a$ the acceleration. Using the equation of state and introducing
$$
\eta = z_b + h
$$
the elevation of the free surface (constant for a lake at rest), we get
$$
\frac{1}{2h}\nabla gh^2 = -g\nabla (\eta - h) = g\nabla h
$$
This identity is obviously verified mathematically, however it is not
necessarily verified by the discrete gradient operator. In the case of
Cartesian meshes it is simple to show that the naive discrete gradient
operator we used above verifies this identity. For tree meshes
this is not generally the case due to the prolongation operator used
to fill ghost cells at refinement boundaries. Rather than trying to
redefine the prolongation operator, we discretise the topographic
source term as
$$
a = -g\nabla z_b = -g \nabla\eta + \frac{g}{2h}\nabla h^2
$$
This is strictly identical mathematically, however if we now use the
same discrete operator to estimate $\nabla p$ and $\nabla h^2$, the
*discrete* lake-at-rest condition becomes 
$$ \nabla\eta = 0 $$
which is much easier to verify.

To do so, we define the following restriction and prolongation
operators for $\eta$. The main idea is to avoid using the elevation of
dry cells. Restriction is done by averaging the elevation of wet
cells. */
