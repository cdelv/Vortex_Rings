# Boussinesq buoyancy

The momentum equation of the [multilayer solver](hydro.h) becomes
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \partial_t \left( h \mathbf{u} \right)_k + \mathbf{{\nabla}} \cdot \left(
  h \mathbf{u}  \mathbf{u} \right)_k & = - gh_k  \mathbf{{\nabla}} (\eta)
  {\color{blue} - \mathbf{{\nabla}} (h q)_k + \left[ q 
  \mathbf{{\nabla}} z \right]_k}
\end{aligned}
$$
where the terms in blue have been added and $q$ is the (hydrostatic)
pressure deviation due to (small) density variations.

The density variations are described by a scalar field $T$, which is
advected by the flow, and an associated "equation of state"
$\Delta\rho(T)$ defined by the user. This gives the additional
equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\partial_t \left( h T \right)_k + \mathbf{{\nabla}} \cdot \left(
h \mathbf{u}  T \right)_k & = 0,\\
q(z) & = \int_0^z g \Delta \rho(T) dz
\end{aligned}
$$
