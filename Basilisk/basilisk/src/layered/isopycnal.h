# Boussinesq buoyancy for isopycnal layers

This adds buoyancy to the [multilayer solver](hydro.h), assuming that
each layer has a constant density variation.

This is a special case of the more general [buoyancy module](dr.h)
which should be consulted for more details.

The density variations in each layer are defined by the user using the
`drho` array whose dimension must match the numbers of layers. */
