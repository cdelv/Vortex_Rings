# Avoid parsing system header files

To avoid parsing large system header files with qcc, we redirect the
preprocessor to the files contained in this directory, which are just
pointers to the system files.

The corresponding typedef/enum declarations necessary for proper
parsing by [basilisk.yacc](/src/ast/basilisk.yacc) need to be added to
[defaults.h](/src/ast/defaults.h).
