/**
# An "all Mach" flow solver

We wish to solve the generic momentum equation
$$
\partial_t\mathbf{q} + \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{q}\mathbf{u}) = 
- \nabla p + \nabla\cdot(\mu\nabla\mathbf{u}) + \rho\mathbf{a}
$$
with $\mathbf{q}=\rho\mathbf{u}$ the momentum, $\mathbf{u}$ the
velocity, $\rho$ the density, $\mu$ the dynamic viscosity, $p$ the
pressure and $\mathbf{a}$ an
acceleration. The pressure is defined through an equation of state and
verifies the evolution equation
$$
\partial_t p + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla p = -\rho c^2\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}
$$
with $c$ the speed of sound. By default the solver sets $c=\infty$,
$\rho=1$ and the pressure equation reduces to 
$$
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = 0
$$

The advection of momentum is not performed by this solver (so that
different schemes can be used) i.e. in the end, by default, we solve
the incompressible (linearised) Euler equations with a projection
method.

We build the solver using the generic time loop and the implicit
viscous solver (which includes the multigrid Poisson--Helmholtz
solver). */
