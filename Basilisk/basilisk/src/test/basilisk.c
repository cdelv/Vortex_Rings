# Computation of a levelset field from a contour

This test case illustrates how to import a contour, represented using
a [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics)
file format, here an [encapsulated
Postscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript)
file and represent it within Basilisk as a distance (i.e. levelset)
field.

We will also use this distance function to compute a VOF
representation of the contour, and test the *tag()* function. */
