# Sessile drop

A sessile drop is a drop of liquid at rest on a solid surface. In the
absence of gravity, the shape of the drop is controlled by surface
tension only. An important parameter is the "contact angle" $\theta$ between
the solid surface and the interface. In the absence of gravity, the
drop is hemispherical and it is easy to show that the relation between
the radius of the drop $R$ and its volume $V$ is (for two-dimensional
drops)
$$
V = R^2 (\theta - \sin\theta\cos\theta)
$$

To test this relation, a drop is initialised as a half-disk (i.e. the
initial contact angle is 90$^\circ$) and the contact angle is varied
between 15$^\circ$ and 165$^\circ$. The drop oscillates and eventually relaxes
to its equilibrium position. This equilibrium is exact to within
machine accuracy. The curvature along the interface is constant.

Note that shallower angles are [not accessible yet](/src/contact.h).
