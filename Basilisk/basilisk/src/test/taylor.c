# Equilibrium of a droplet suspended in an electric field 

A droplet suspended in a fluid subjected to a uniform electric field
deforms due to the competing effect of electrical forces and surface
tension. If the electrification level is moderate an equilibrium shape
is reached. It was observed experimentally that droplets deforms as
prolate or oblate spheroids (i.e. larger elongation aligned with the
external electric field or viceversa). The analytical analysis of
[O'Konski \& Thacher (1953)](#konski1953) unexpectedly predicted
prolate forms whereas the experiments showed oblate ones (and
viceversa).

It was the genius of [Geoffrey Taylor (1966)](#taylor1966) who shed
light on the problem. The work of O'Konski \& Thacher assumed that
both fluids (inner and outer) were perfect dielectrics, given the low
conductivity of the fluids involved. Taylor realized that the
conductivity could be very low but it was not zero, so that the
charges could migrate through the "leaky" media, thus accumulating at
the fluid interface and altering radically the pattern of electrical
forces.

Moreover, approximating the electrostatic Maxwell equations with the
Taylor--Melcher leaky dielectric model and assuming small deformation
Taylor predicted recirculating velocities and provided analytical
expressions for the radial and azimuthal velocities as functions of
the dimensionless radius $r$ and the azimuthal coordinate $\theta$.
For $r < 1$ this gives,
$$
v_r =  Ar(1-r^2)(3\cos^2 \theta -1)  \quad \mathrm{and} \quad  
v_\theta = 3Ar/2 \left( 1-5r^2/3 \right)\cos 2\theta
$$
and for $r \ge 1$,
$$
v_r = A(r^{-4}-r^{-2})(3\cos^2 \theta -1) \quad \mathrm{and} \quad
v_\theta = -Ar^{-4} \sin 2\theta
$$
with
$$
A = -\frac{9}{10}  \frac{E_\infty^2 R_d \varepsilon_o}{
\mu_o} \frac{1}{1+\lambda}\frac{R-Q}{(R+2)^2},
$$
where $R$, $Q$ and $\lambda$ are the ratio of inner to outer
conductivity, permittivity and viscosity, respectively. $E_\infty$ is
the imposed electrid field, $R_d$ the droplet radius, $\varepsilon_o$
is the outer permittivity and $\mu_2$ is the outer viscosity. The
electrical forces induces recirculations in both (viscous) fluids.

This test case is also discussed in 
[Lopez-Herrera et al, 2011](/src/references.bib#lopez-herrera2011).
