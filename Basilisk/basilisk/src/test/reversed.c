# Time-reversed VOF advection in a vortex

This classical test advects and stretches an initially circular
interface in a non-divergent vortical flow. The flow reverts in time
and the interface should come back to its original position. The
difference between the initial and final shapes is a measure of the
errors accumulated during advection.

This also checks that a constant "VOF concentration" remains constant
when it is advected with the VOF tracer.

We will need the advection solver combined with the VOF advection
scheme. */

The shapes of the interface at $t=0$, $t=T/4$, $t=T/2$, $t=3T/4$ and
$t=T$ are displayed below for both sets of simulations (constant and
adaptive), for $N=128$. The shapes for $t=T/4$ should be identical to
those for $t=3T/4$ and similarly for $t=0$ and $t=T$ (for which we
measure the error). Note that the errors for $t=3T/4$ seem to be much
larger than those for $t=T$.
