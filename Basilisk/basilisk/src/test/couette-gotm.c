# Turbulent Couette flow

See [the GOTM web site](https://gotm.net/cases/couette) and
section 12.1.1 of [the GOTM manual](#gotm).

"The Couette scenario is the most basic of all GOTM scenarios. It
represents a shallow (10 m deep), unstratified layer of fluid above a
flat bottom that is driven by a constant surface stress in the
x-direction. Earth's rotation is ignored. This flow is often referred
to as turbulent Couette flow. After the onset of the surface stress, a
thin turbulent near-surface layer is generated that rapidly entrains
into the non-turbulent deeper parts of the water column. The solution
at the end of the simulation, when the problem has become fully
stationary, is shown in the figure below."
