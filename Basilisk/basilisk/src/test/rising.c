# Rising bubble

A two-dimensional bubble is released in a rectangular box and raises
under the influence of buoyancy. This test case was proposed by
[Hysing et al, 2009](/src/references.bib#hysing2009) (see also [the
FEATFLOW
page](http://www.featflow.de/en/benchmarks/cfdbenchmarking/bubble.html)).

We solve the incompressible, variable-density, Navier--Stokes
equations with interfaces and surface tension. We can solve either the
axisymmetric or planar version. We can used standard or "reduced"
gravity. */

## Results

The final shape of the bubble is compared to that obtained with the
MooNMD Lagrangian solver (see [the FEATFLOW
page](http://www.featflow.de/en/benchmarks/cfdbenchmarking/bubble/bubble_verification.html))
at the highest resolution. We also display the shape of the
axisymmetric version of the test. The axisymmetric bubble moves much
faster.

For test case 2, the mesh in Basilisk is too coarse to accurately
resolve the skirt.

The agreement for the bubble rise velocity with time is also good.
