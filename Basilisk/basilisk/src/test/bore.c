# Undular bores for the Green-Naghdi equations

This test case was proposed by [Le MÃ©tayer et al,
2010](/src/references.bib#lemetayer2010) (section 6.2). This is a dam
break problem described by the (dispersive) [Green-Naghdi

Saint-Venant equations). */

At $t = 48$ seconds, the depth and velocity profiles are given
below. They are compared with the numerical solution of the same
problem obtained with the Saint-Venant solver ([bore1.c]()).

The solution consists of localized undular bores superposed onto the
Saint-Venant solution. This demonstrates the robustness of the
numerical scheme.
