# Ohmic conduction flux of charged species

This function computes the fluxes due to ohmic conduction appearing in
the [Nernst--Planck
equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst%E2%80%93Planck_equation). The
species charge concentrations are then updated using the explicit
scheme
$$
c^{n+1}_i = c^n_i +\Delta t \, \nabla \cdot( K_i c^n_i \nabla \phi^n)
$$ 
where $c_i$ is the volume density of the $i$-specie, $K_i$ its volume
electric conductivity and $\phi$ the electric potential. */
